Dear Sir/Madam,

Subject: 

Why do you like me more than everyone else?
Ans: I have great experience of working in many companies, I have used different software in different companies and gained a lot of experience from which I have developed many sites for those companies. And I am an enterprising person, I can work in any sector, and I think all kinds of work will be done by me. If you check a little about me, you will know very easily.

Why have I done so many jobs?
Ans: I grew up in many realities, and I had to do all the work myself, from the age of 16-17 I started doing a lot of jobs, sacrifices, because I had to pay for my own expenses and
The family had to bear the expenses. And in all these jobs I learned programming, I took programming as my passion, so I used to spend time in programming because I wanted to discover new products through programming because I loved programming so much.


Please see the attachment.
Here I have given my two resumes. Because I want to do the work. A resume from a few years ago, and one from a few months ago, I have not attached my professional projects to all of them because I have not yet hosted professional projects, but you can verify me in any way, I am ready to take any exam.
